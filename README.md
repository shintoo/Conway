#Conway's Game of Life

Implementation of the popular hit, "Conway's Game of Life"!


##Usage
```
./Life <generations> <text file>
``` 
If generations is 0, it will run until killed externally.  
 
As of right now, you must surround your grid with a border for it to work correctly. See the example to get the idea (no alive cells on border).
